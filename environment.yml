### NOTE!  `pip -e .` installs tstrippy in the environment.

## Note that I only need to add the simplest dependencies here. The rest will be installed automatically. 
## It's better to avoid pip because it pip will always update a new dependencies. 
## For example, before  I used pip install matplotlib which upgraded numpy to version 2 and also the most recent version of matplotlib
## in the end, the main constraint is that I need to use numpy 1.22 and setuptools 68.2 for the fotran compiler.
## The other package versions are specified only becuase they are the versions that are compatible with numpy 1.22. 
## Also, versions of python newer than 3.9 do work.
